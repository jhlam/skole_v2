\section*{Abstract}


Information Diffusion is often used for different simulations in network research because it simulates how information propagates thorough a network. Measuring spread and speed, we can find influential targets in the network. Such targets are optimal targets to pass message during disaster scenario, vaccinate to prevent spreading of a disease, or even targets for viral marketing. 


High Level Synthesis (HLS) have in recent years matured greatly. With HLS, designing custom architectures  is no longer a dream.
