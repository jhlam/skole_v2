\section*{Foreword}

This thesis concludes my study in Computer Science at the Department
of Computer and Information Science (IDI) at the Norwegian University
of Science and Technology (NTNU). The supervisor for this thesis was Professor
Donn Alexander Morrison.


I would like to thank Donn Alexander Morrison and Yaman Umuroglu for providing helpful advice and feedback throughout this thesis, and answering e-mails from me way past midnight. 
I would also like to thank my girlfriend, family and friends for helping and supporting me through these five years here in NTNU. A special thanks to my friend Magnus Halvorsen  for proofreading, his insights, and critique.
