\chapter{Conclusion}
For placeholder, need to have some text here. 

This paper works as a proof of concept, where we can see that with minimal knowledge regarding HLS, I was able to generate a simple Sparse Matrix vector multiplication IP-core. We can see from the result from co-simulation, that custom core ran much better then the other. HLS was easy to use and provided with a quick development time. There are still some problem with the HLS tools, but compared to earlier version, this is much better.

\begin{itemize}
\item HLS was great tool
\item The custom core appears to be good. 
\item result is promising, shows potentiall
\item HLS is great, allows rapid development and optimization.
\item There is room for improvement, but still a promising field.
\item There are still some random bugs in HLS.
\item Not many clear tutorials for HLS
\end{itemize}
