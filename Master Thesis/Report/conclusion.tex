\chapter{Conclusion}
In this report, we have explored the possibility to use HLS as an implementation tool to accelerate seed selection for information diffusion. We used a modified version of sparse matrix-vector multiplication to perform ICM iterations. We have implemented a simple IP-core that applies ICM with an adjacency matrix and a set of seed nodes. The core returns the percentage of infected nodes in the network. The design was loaded onto an FPGA and multiple tests were conducted both on the chip and in the simulation.

In this project, we were not able to synthesise an IP-core that could compute large matrices. By synthesising an  IP-core with s larger buffer, the resource usage was much higher than what was available on our Zedboard. This is likely the result of lack of customization of the high-level implementation.
 

\textbf{Task 1 \textit{(mandatory)}} Implement information diffusion as sparse matrix-vector multiplication, with high level language C. Completed

W have in this project implemented a modified sparse matrix-vector multiplication that perform ICM. The implementation detail can be found in Chapter \ref{methode}, and the theory can be found at \ref{background}  \\ \hfil \\ \hfil
\textbf{Task 2 \textit{(mandatory)}} Tailor the implementation of Information Diffusion for synthesise with Vivado HLS. Complete \\

The design was able to synthesise in Xilinx Vivado HLS and gave back somewhat interesting results. The detail about the HLS and different optimization used can be found at chapter \ref{methode}.  \\ \hfil \\ \hfil
\textbf{Task 3 \textit{(optional)}} Implement said design on a  Zynq FPGA board.\\

Out IP-core was able to upload on the FPGA and gave back the result. Chapter \ref{result} presents the result from the FPGA and other

\textbf{Task 4 \textit{(optional)}} Extend the system to be able to handle graph in the size of toy graphs(containing $2^{26})$ vertices) \\ \hfil \\ \hfil

Due to unfamiliarity with HLS and time constraints. We were not able to extend the system to compute larger graph.  \\
