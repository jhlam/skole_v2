\section*{Assignment}
Information diffusion is a field of network research where a message, starting
at a set of seed nodes, is propagated through the edges in a graph according to
a simple model. Simulations are used to measure the coverage and speed of the
diffusion and are useful in modelling a variety of phenomena such as the spread
of disease, memes on the Internet, viral marketing and emergency messages in
disaster scenarios.

The effectiveness of a given spreading model is dependent on the initially
infected nodes, or seeds. Seed selection for an optimal spread is an NP hard
problem and is normally approximated by selecting high-degree nodes or using
heuristic methods such as discount-degree or choosing nodes at different levels
of the k-core.

High-level synthesis (HLS) is becoming an important tool in the
optimization/acceleration of algorithms in hardware. Starting with an algorithm
written in a high-level language such as C or C++, HLS aids with hardware
design by providing a methodology and tools that guide the developer through
the design process.

This project should employ HLS as a design methodology for hardware accelerated
seed selection in large graphs. The student will study seed selection for a
given diffusion model, write a high-level model, and use HLS to implement a
hardware design that exploits parallelism in the seed selection algorithm in
order to improve performance over a GPCPU implementation.
